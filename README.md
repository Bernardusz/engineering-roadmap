# 🖥 Engineering-roadmap - 2.5 Year Plan
> A repository, connected centrally to my GitHub projects for tracking my progress and making sure I'm not lost in learning.

## ❓ Why?
> I grew out of my past self. I hate uncertainty and abstraction now, so I want a concise plan I can follow.

## 📈 How do I track my progress
- Use [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for what I did per domain and my reflections afterwards.
- My GitHub project is a general roadmap with tasks I'll mark
- And issues, I will put along the way

## 📖 Goal
> Be a language and framework-agnostic, future-proof, better, and robust programmer and developer 🐧

## Repo structure
- [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) - For what I did per domain and my reflections afterwards.
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) - My plan put to words in a .md file.
- [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md) - All my big projects put to motion.

## 🐧 In the end
> Remember, at the end of the day, is the end of the day 🐧💀. Okay, just kidding, at the end of the day, I don't want to be lost, I want to be structured, so here I am following a plan I made on January 16th, 2026.
